# PacketSniffer
This Python script lets you sniff packet details and metadata sent in the network. In order to run this program please make sure you have Python3 downloaded. You can do so from here: https://www.python.org/downloads/
The PacketSniffer program is also based on Linux socket support and therefore may not run correctly on a Windows environment. To run this script you will also need admin control. You can get this by running the script with the "sudo" command before it in the terminal like so:

sudo python3 PacketSniff.py
